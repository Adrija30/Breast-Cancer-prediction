# Breast-Cancer-prediction

> This is a prediction model for BREAST CANCER using Logistic Regression,Nayev Bayes,KNN,Support Vector Machine algorithm. Here I also calculate the accuracy of each model for better comparison.

## General info
Breast Cancer is one of the highest growing threat to the womans all over the world.It's fatality rate is not much if it is diagonosed in early stage. My model is about to help for the detection of breast cancer.\
*DATA COLLECTION :\
            I've collected data from Kaggle.\
*DATA ANALYSIS:\
            In my dataset there are 569 rows(records) and 32 columns.\

 DATA PREPROCESSING:\
                   In this stage I've treat categorical values, cleaned the data,remove the outliers(using Boxplot only).\
PREDICTIVE MODEL BUILDING:\ 
                   I've divided the remaining recoord in training and testing dataset and then make predictive model with the help of that.\
ACCURACY:\
        As I've used 4 different algorithms so I also find out the accuracy of each model.

## Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook(Anaconda): Python 3
* Library used :PANDAS,NUMPY,MATPLOTLIB,sklearn

## Setup
Installation link of Anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads

## Code Examples

`put-your-code-here`

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* You just have to put values of the requirements and you will get a prediction of being malignant or benign.
* All the models have around 90% accuracy using different approach.
* easy to understand

To-do list:
* Want to work with real-life dataset.
* Want to implement various other approches.
## Status
Project is: Ongoing.
## Inspiration
Got help from Kaggle,Github and other resources.
